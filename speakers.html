      How many different speakers have visited TED Talks? How many speeches has each had? Who's been the most popular speaker by count of talks or by views?
      <br><br>
      With this graph you can examine speaker data and find interesting information about TED speakers beginning from year 1972. Each bubble represents one speaker. The size of the bubble tells how many viewing times has each speaker had by average in their speeches. The color of the bubble tells the number of speeches held by a speaker.
      <br><br>
      By clicking the buttons above the graph, you can follow each bubble moving to their designated value area according to the button variable. With the buttons you can examine, when did each speaker hold a speech for the first time, how popular is each speaker by the number of views (by average), or how many speeches has each speaker had so far. With the slider next to the buttons, you can choose the number of speakers that the graph is showing to you. By default graph shows all the speakers, but by sliding to the left, you can decrease the number. Graph will gradually drop out speakers with smallest number of speeches and smallest number of viewing times.
