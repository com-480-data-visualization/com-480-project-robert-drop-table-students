        Speakers graph presents the data from TED speakers as bubbles. Size implies the level of interest and popularity of a speaker with the <strong>total number of times</strong> their speeches have been watched, where as the color implies the same thing but with the <strong>number of talks</strong> each speaker has had so far.<br><br>
        We can see from the number of new speakers in the graph that the popularity of TED has been vastly growing during last decade.<br><br>
        We can also see that holding an interesting speech after speech is difficult, as the average number of speeches seems to be between one and four million for the speakers having held more than one speech. On the contrary, a bunch of one-timers have the average around 20 million with highest average being over 40 million.<br><br>
        To see all bubbles, swipe the slider to the rightmost end.<br><br> Watch out not to forget yourself to the world of TEDdy bubbles!
