      Main event, the cornerstone of TED, has been held yearly since 1990. In
      2005, a sister conference TEDGlobal was introduced. 
      In the year 2009 TED format was opened for independent events called TEDx, 
      rapidly increasing the number of TED events held worldwide per year.

      TEDGlobal and TEDx events have increased the global presence of TED.

      There are also some other temporal developments: Average duration of the
      talks in the main events decreased from 18 minutes to 13 minutes in 2006 and 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, TEDx have not been keen in decreasing the time talks: Most of
      them are between 13 and 20. TEDx events also are less successfull than
      main and global events: Few talks from the TEDx events are considered good
      enough to be uploaded in TED Talks. Also, it seems that TEDx talks have
      on average fewer talks than global/main event talks
