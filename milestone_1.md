This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas. Please, fill the following sections about your project. 



# Dataset (Erik?)
 Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing. 




# Problematic (Antti)
Our main goal with the visualization is to provide better understanding on what
makes a good talk or a good lecture. We will achieve this goal with the
following tasks: 
-We combine ratings and the number of comments to a sum-variable "performance"
-Keep performance as a continuous variable, and show how performance is linked
to other variables
-Make performance discrete by considering 5% of the best ted talks as their own group. 



Our secondary goal with visualizing TED-talks is to look at the relationships between the
lectures. After visualizing these relationships, User can find interesting talks
that are closely related on some pivot TED-talk. As TED is an acronym for 
"Technology, enterntainment, design", we are curious to look whether there is
some clustering of talks to these three dimensions.


Our target audience are new university students, as their presentation skills
are often limited due to the lack expression related courses in high-school curriculum.


-Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
-What am I trying to show with my visualization?
-Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.







#Exploratory Data Analysis (Maria)
pictures etc
Jupyter notebook with eda:
how clean the data is, missing values
distributions of different variables - histograms, boxplots
correlation


Explore tags:
-Counts per tag,
-Histogram of number of tags by counts
-what are the 30 most popular tags?


Tags -> dictionary all talks
Take average of ratings of each tag



# Related work (Erik?)
-What others have already done with the data?
-Why is your approach original?
-What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
-In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
